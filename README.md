Hello, my name is Elena Litvinova. I am a Software Engineer with a Master's degree and over 14 years of commercial experience. In this repo, I am going to push tasks that I solve to prepare for interviews without using modern technologies like ChatGPT. I am trying to make decisions with the best Time Complexity and Space Complexity.
